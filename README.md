# Alula
Course : Design in Screen <br>
Date : January to April 2020 <br>
Members : Me <br>
Languages and Tools : Figma, HTML5, CSS3 <br>

As part of the Graphic Design on Screen course, the professor asked us to choose an exhibition for which we were to create a web page. My choice was the Alula exhibition which took place from October 9, 2019 to March 8, 2020 at the Institut du Monde Arabe (Paris). <br>
I encountered various problems: I couldn't hide the excess white around the images in the carousel and it goes over the banner when you scroll down. I also encountered a problem with the integration of external fonts in the web page.
